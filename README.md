# TrollRecorder

**WIP (Work-In-Progress)**: A simple audio recorder for TrollStore.

Partial codes in `audio-recorder` and `audio-mixer` are not open-sourced because they're provided by my friends.

## Milestones

- [x] Playing &amp; recording via command-line interface
- [x] Pause &amp; resume via signals (`SIGUSR1` &amp; `SIGUSR2`)
- [x] Phone call recording via command-line interface
- [x] Mix/combine stereo audio from both sides of a phone call
- [ ] Elegant app by [@Lakr233](https://github.com/Lakr233)
- [ ] Launch in background via App or “Shortcuts”
- [ ] Status indicator and toolbar with a global HUD
- [ ] Use `SFSpeechRecognizer` to transcribe records (Advanced features may need purchase)
